                <li>600 grams (1¼ ounces) beef rump steak, sliced thinly</li>
                <li>1 medium brown onion (150g), sliced thinly</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
                <li>400 grams (12½ ounces) button mushrooms, sliced thickly</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dry red wine</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                <li>1¼ cups (300g) sour cream</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh dill</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>Method</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat half the oil in a large frying pan over high heat; cook beef, in batches, until browned lightly. Remove from pan.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining oil in the same pan; cook onion and garlic, stirring, for 4 minutes or until onion softens. Add paprika and mushrooms; cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until mushrooms are tender. Season to taste.</li>
                <li>Return beef to pan with wine and juice; bring to the boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, for about 5 minutes or until beef is tender. Add paste, sour cream, and dill; cook, stirring, until heated through. Serve stroganoff with steamed rice, mashed potato, or fettuccine.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <strong>Sweet Paprika</strong>
            <p>Sweet paprika, also known as Hungarian paprika, is a spice derived from various forms of dried capsicum (bell pepper) and is used extensively throughout Europe. It’s one of the defining flavors of a stroganoff. Don’t be tempted to use smoked paprika (used in Spanish cooking), as it will overwhelm the flavors of the dish.</p>

            <strong>Test Kitchen Tip</strong>
            <p>Five tips for the best beef stroganoff:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less is more when it comes to browning. Ensure the pan is very hot. Cook the meat in batches, without overcrowding the pan, or the meat will stew.</li>
                <li>Use prime cuts for fast, pan-fried stroganoff recipes (like this one) and secondary cuts for slow-cooked versions.</li>
                <li>Cook the meat fast and briefly to prevent overcooking.</li>
                <li>Once the sour cream is added, heat gently and do not allow the mixture to boil, or it will curdle.</li>
                <li>Season at the end to bring the flavors together.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>What do you eat beef stroganoff with?</strong>
            <p>Steamed rice, pasta, or a side of bread are some of the most common ways beef stroganoff is served. A traditional stroganoff in Russia might come with roast potato or even chips. For example, the popular Cafe Pushkin in Moscow serves beef stroganoff with your choice of “Potatoes a la Pushkin” (roasted, thinly sliced potatoes), sautéed vegetables, or a green salad. So the choice of what to eat it with is basically up to you.</p>
            <br>
            <strong>What is the sauce in beef stroganoff made of?</strong>
            <p>Sour cream is an essential ingredient in beef stroganoff and has been part of the earliest recipes according to details from Encyclopaedia Britannica. Onion is also an important ingredient for authentic flavor. Some recipes (including this one) also have tomato and red wine, while others may include mustard.</p>
            <br>
            <strong>What cut of meat is best for beef stroganoff?</strong>
            <p>Beef stroganoff can be made with different cuts, depending on your budget and the recipe. While beef tenderloin would be a restaurant’s go-to, there are less expensive options that work just as well. For a pan-fried stroganoff (like this one), try scotch fillet, rump steak, or sirloin. In fact, some would say these cuts are more flavorsome due to the marbling of the meat.</p>
